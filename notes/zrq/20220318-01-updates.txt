    # Which looks like this issue.
    # https://github.com/containers/buildah/issues/2168

    #
    # Comment at the ned suggests this is an issue with 'crun'.
    # https://github.com/containers/buildah/issues/2168#issuecomment-587388143

        I think /usr/share/containers/seccomp.json already has an entry for clone that filters
        for flags argument, it's just that crun does not apply it correctly.
        This crun upstream fix has fixed the issue for me.

    #
    # linux: use correct indices for seccomp arguments
    # https://github.com/containers/crun/commit/08efb1e31597a435c7afd59e844d35c4888841e9

    #
    # Fix went in it Feb 2020, so it might already be in the latest Fedora.
    # Tyrosine has a more recent version of Fedora, we should try the build there.
